# ASR Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ASR Architecture Implementation
- ✓ Implemented `WhisperClient` class in `backend/asr/whisper_client.py`
  - Handles real-time audio processing with OpenAI Whisper API
  - Supports language detection and configuration
  - Implements callback-based result delivery
  - Manages audio buffering and chunking

- ✓ Implemented `SmartAudioBuffer` class in `backend/asr/audio_buffer.py`
  - Manages audio buffering with configurable chunk duration
  - Supports overlap between chunks for better continuity
  - Integrates VAD for optimal speech detection

- ✓ Implemented `HybridVAD` class in `backend/asr/vad.py`
  - Combines energy-based and zero-crossing rate detection
  - Adaptive threshold adjustment based on noise floor
  - Optional WebRTC VAD integration for improved accuracy

### 2. Server Integration
- ✓ Fixed import paths in `server.py`
- ✓ Integrated ASR components with Socket.IO events
- ✓ Implemented real-time audio streaming from AudioCapture to WhisperClient
- ✓ Added language configuration support via Socket.IO events

### 3. Configuration
- ✓ OpenAI API key configuration in `config.py`
- ✓ Audio parameters (sample rate, channels, chunk duration)
- ✓ Language settings with auto-detection support

## Usage

### Setting up ASR

1. Configure OpenAI API key in `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

3. The ASR will automatically initialize when recording starts if API key is configured

### Socket.IO Events

- `set_languages`: Configure source and target languages
  ```javascript
  socket.emit('set_languages', {
    sourceLanguage: 'zh',  // or 'auto' for detection
    targetLanguage: 'en'
  });
  ```

- `transcription`: Receives transcription results
  ```javascript
  socket.on('transcription', (data) => {
    console.log('Text:', data.text);
    console.log('Language:', data.language);
    console.log('Timestamp:', data.timestamp);
  });
  ```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify ASR functionality:
```bash
python test_asr.py
```

## Notes

- The system requires an active OpenAI API key with Whisper API access
- Audio is processed in chunks of 5 seconds by default (configurable)
- VAD helps optimize API usage by only sending speech segments
- The system supports multiple languages with auto-detection capability
