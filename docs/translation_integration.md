# Translation Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Translation Client Implementation
- ✓ Implemented `TranslationClient` class in `backend/api/translation_client.py`
  - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model for translation
  - Supports context-aware translation for better coherence
  - Maintains translation history for consistency
  - Supports batch translation

### 2. Translation Service Implementation
- ✓ Implemented `TranslationService` class in `backend/models/translation_service.py`
  - Manages real-time translation of ASR output
  - Smart sentence buffering to handle partial ASR results
  - Caching mechanism to avoid duplicate translations
  - Configurable timeout for partial sentence translation
  - Context management for improved translation quality

### 3. Server Integration
- ✓ Integrated translation service with Socket.IO events in `server.py`
- ✓ Translation service automatically starts when recording begins
- ✓ ASR results are automatically fed to translation service
- ✓ Translation results are emitted via Socket.IO

## Features

### Context-Aware Translation
The system maintains context from previous translations to improve coherence and consistency, especially important for real-time speech translation where context can significantly improve accuracy.

### Sentence Buffering
The translation service intelligently buffers partial sentences from ASR output and translates complete sentences when detected. This includes:
- Detection of sentence delimiters (. ! ? 。 ！ ？ ；)
- Timeout mechanism for partial sentences
- Maximum buffer size to prevent overflow

### Translation Caching
Recently translated text is cached to:
- Avoid duplicate API calls
- Improve performance
- Reduce costs

## Socket.IO Events

### Backend → Frontend Events

- `translation`: Emits translation results
  ```javascript
  {
    source_text: "原文",
    translation: "Translation",
    source_language: "zh",
    target_language: "en",
    timestamp: 1234567890.123,
    error: null  // or error message if failed
  }
  ```

### Frontend → Backend Events

- `set_languages`: Configure translation languages
  ```javascript
  socket.emit('set_languages', {
    sourceLanguage: 'zh',  // or 'auto'
    targetLanguage: 'en'
  });
  ```

## Configuration

Translation settings in `config.py`:
- `OPENAI_MODEL_TRANSLATION`: GPT model for translation (default: gpt-4o-mini)
- `DEFAULT_SOURCE_LANGUAGE`: Default source language (default: auto)
- `DEFAULT_TARGET_LANGUAGE`: Default target language (default: en)
- `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`: Dictionary of supported language codes

## Testing

Run the translation test script:
```bash
python test_translation.py
```

## API Requirements

The translation feature requires:
- OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o-mini
- Sufficient API quota for translation requests

## Architecture Flow

1. Audio captured → AudioCapture
2. Audio buffered → SmartAudioBuffer
3. Audio transcribed → WhisperClient
4. Transcription result → TranslationService
5. Translation result → Socket.IO → Frontend

## Next Steps

To use the translation feature:
1. Ensure OpenAI API key is configured in `.env`
2. Start the server with `python server.py`
3. Configure languages via Socket.IO
4. Start recording to begin real-time translation
